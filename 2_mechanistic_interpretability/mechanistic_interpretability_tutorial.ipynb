The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to try to fix this! It is a very young and growing field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **For a list of open problems feel free to check out this [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WONBzNqfKIxERejrrPlQMyKqg7jSFW92x5UMXNrMdPo/edit#) to figure out where to start.**\n",

You can disable this behaviour by setting the flag `prepend_bos=False` in `to_tokens`, `to_str_tokens`, `model.forward` and any other function that converts strings to multi-token tensors.\n",

        "`prepend_bos` is a bit of a hack, and I've gone back and forth on what the correct default here is. The reason I do this is that transformers tend to treat the first token weirdly - this doesn't really matter in training (where all inputs are >1000 tokens), but this can be a big issue when investigating short prompts! The reason for this is that attention patterns are a probability distribution and so need to add up to one, so to simulate being \"off\" they normally look at the first token. Giving them a BOS token lets the heads rest by looking at that, preserving the information in the first \"real\" token.\n",

        "A key insight from the Mathematical Frameworks paper is that we should focus on interpreting the parts of the model that are intrinsically interpretable - the input tokens, the output logits and the attention patterns. Everything else (the residual stream, keys, queries, values, etc) are compressed intermediate states when calculating meaningful things. So a natural place to start is classifying heads by their attention patterns on various texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "When doing interpretability, it's always good to begin by visualising your data, rather than taking summary statistics. Summary statistics can be super misleading! But now that we have visualised the attention patterns, we can create some basic summary statistics and use our visualisations to validate them! (Accordingly, being good at web dev/data visualisation is a surprisingly useful skillset! Neural networks are very high-dimensional object.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's visualize the attention pattern of all the heads in layer 0, using [Alan Cooney's CircuitsVis library](https://github.com/alan-cooney/CircuitsVis) (based on Anthropic's PySvelte library). If you did the previous set of exercises, you'll have seen this library before.\n",

        "* `tokens`: List of tokens, which should have the same length as the `seq_len` dimension of `attention`. Make sure you're not accidentally passing in a list with a dummy dimension, or that differs from `seq_len` because of the BOS token!\n",
        "\n",
        "This visualization is interactive! Try hovering over a token or head, and click to lock.

Note, if you display this in VSCode then it may exhibit a bug where the main plot continually shrinks in size - if this happens, you should instead save the HTML (i.e. with `html = cv.attention.attention_heads(...); with open(\"attn_heads.html\", \"w\") as f: f.write(str(html))`) and open the plot in your browser."

This means that **the residual stream can't directly encode positional information**.\n",

        "[PyTorch hooks](https://blog.paperspace.com/pytorch-hooks-gradient-clipping-debugging/) are a great and underrated, yet incredibly janky, feature. They can act on a layer, and edit the input or output of that layer, or the gradient when applying autodiff. The key difference is that **Hook points** act on *activations* not layers. This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied. This adjustment was shamelessly inspired by [Garcon's use of ProbePoints](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html).\n",
        "\n",
        "They also come with a range of other quality of life improvements. PyTorch's hooks are global state, which can be a massive pain if you accidentally leave a hook on a model. TransformerLens hooks are also global state, but `run_with_hooks` tries to create an abstraction where these are local state by removing all hooks at the end of the function (and they come with a helpful `model.reset_hooks()` method to remove all hooks).\n",
